# smartHumidor
Ambient monitoring feat. ESP8266, DHT22, OLED and IOT services

A project which was born with a new thread on the italian forum 'Accademia del Fumo Lento' (<i>Slow Smoke Academy</i>), which aims to convert a cheap wine refrigerator into a 'smart' humidor to store cigars, remote check their humidity/temperature, control the air recirculation and more..

Currently, the result is in working state.
